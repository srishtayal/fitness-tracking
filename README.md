# Fitness Tracker

This is a Python project for tracking fitness data, including daily steps, calories burned, and heart rate. The data is generated randomly for a 30-day period and analyzed to give insights into daily and weekly fitness trends. The project uses `numpy` and `matplotlib` to calculate averages, correlations, and visualize the data.

## Features

- **Random Fitness Data Generation**: Generates random steps, calories burned, and heart rate data for 30 days.
- **Analysis**: Calculates the average steps, calories burned, and heart rate.
- **Insights**: Identifies the day with maximum and minimum steps.
- **Weekly Statistics**: Provides weekly averages for steps, calories, and heart rate.
- **Correlation**: Analyzes the correlation between steps, calories, and heart rate.
- **Visualization**: Displays graphs showing trends and relationships between the data.
